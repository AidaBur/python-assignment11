Reflection on Visualization and Dashboards

1. Differences Between Static and Interactive Visualizations:
Static visualizations are fixed images such as charts or plots that provide insights but don’t allow user interaction. They're quick to generate and easy to read but limited in depth. Interactive visualizations, on the other hand, let users explore data dynamically — for example, filtering, zooming, or selecting variables. This makes it easier to discover patterns or test hypotheses.

2. Advantages of Using Dashboards:
Dashboards are great for real-time data exploration. They allow users to view key metrics and change filters without writing any code. This makes dashboards especially valuable for non-technical users or teams who need fast insights. Dashboards are also useful for monitoring live data, like financial metrics or sales trends.

3. Improving Communication with Plotly and Dash:
Interactive tools like Plotly and Dash make it easier to communicate complex data clearly. Instead of sending multiple charts, professionals can provide one dynamic dashboard where others can explore the data themselves. This reduces back-and-forth, speeds up understanding, and allows better decision-making based on data.
